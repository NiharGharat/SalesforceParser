> Design
	1. Stateless

> User
	- Stateful
		- Token provided from external sources
	- Stateless
		- Obtain tokens and do the proc

> Questions?
	- Expose all avbl api as REST apis to be consumed - Sort of like universal consumer
	- Can a user use already used tokens and work with them?
	- Do a scanner for resources
	- Have keys like userName pwd stored in env vars and then use them in the app
